# Polkadot Batch Transactions

This script helps you batch multiple Polkadot transactions from a CSV file and generates the call data for use with polkadot.js apps.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Prepare your CSV file with addresses and amounts:
   - The CSV should have two columns: `address` and `amount`
   - Addresses should be valid Polkadot addresses
   - Amounts should be in DOT (e.g., 1.5 for 1.5 DOT)

Example CSV format:
```
address,amount
5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY,1.5
5FHneW46xGXgs5mUiveU4sbTyGBzmstUspZC92UhjJM694ty,0.75
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
npm start
```

3. The script will output the call data, which you can copy and use in polkadot.js apps:
   - Go to [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/)
   - Navigate to "Developer" > "Extrinsics"
   - Select your account
   - From the dropdown, select "utility" > "batchAll"
   - Expand "batchAll" and click on "Add Item"
   - Select "Hex call data as bytes"
   - Paste the call data generated by this script
   - Submit the transaction

## Customization

You can modify the `index.js` file to:
- Connect to a different Polkadot network
- Change the transaction type
- Adjust the parsing logic for different CSV formats

## Notes

- Always verify the batch call details before submitting on polkadot.js
- Remember that the batch will fail entirely if any single transaction fails
- You might need to increase the existential deposit parameter based on your specific needs
